[Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) for the web with [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) API compatibility — giving you a proper VT100 implementation in the browser, not a JavaScript approximation of one.

- Migrate from xterm by changing your import: `@xterm/xterm` → `ghostty-web`
- WASM-compiled parser from Ghostty—the same code that runs the native app
- Zero runtime dependencies, ~400KB WASM bundle

## Try It

```bash
npx @ghostty-web/demo@next
```

This starts a local HTTP server with a real shell on `http://localhost:8080`. Works best on Linux and macOS.

## Comparison with xterm.js

xterm.js is everywhere—VS Code, Hyper, countless web terminals. But it has fundamental issues:

| Issue                                    | xterm.js                                                            | ghostty-web                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **RTL languages**                        | [Broken since 2017](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/701) | ✓ Works                    |
| **Complex scripts** (Devanagari, Arabic) | Rendering issues                                                    | ✓ Proper grapheme handling |
| **XTPUSHSGR/XTPOPSGR**                   | [Not supported](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/2570)    | ✓ Full support             |

xterm.js reimplements terminal emulation in JavaScript. Every escape sequence, every edge case, every Unicode quirk—all hand-coded. Ghostty's emulator is the same battle-tested code that runs the native Ghostty app.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ghostty-web
```

## Usage

ghostty-web aims to be API-compatible with the xterm.js API.

```javascript
import { init, Terminal } from 'ghostty-web';

await init();

const term = new Terminal({
  fontSize: 14,
  theme: {
    background: '#1a1b26',
    foreground: '#a9b1d6',
  },
});

term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
term.onData((data) => websocket.send(data));
websocket.onmessage = (e) => term.write(e.data);
```

For a comprehensive client <-> server example, refer to the [demo](./demo/index.html#L141).

## Development

ghostty-web builds from Ghostty's source with a [patch](./patches/ghostty-wasm-api.patch) to expose additional
functionality.

> Requires Zig and Bun.

```bash
bun run build
```

Mitchell Hashimoto (author of Ghostty) has [been working](https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming) on `libghostty` which makes this all possible. The patches are very minimal thanks to the work the Ghostty team has done, and we expect them to get smaller.

This library will eventually consume a native Ghostty WASM distribution once available, and will continue to provide an xterm.js compatible API.

At Coder we're big fans of Ghostty, so kudos to that team for all the amazing work.
